You are an expert full-stack AI app developer and UI/UX designer.
Upgrade my existing "Devmate v2.0 – Powered by Gemini Pro" into **Devmate v2.1**, an advanced ChatGPT-like web app that is smarter, visually polished, and fully responsive.

### 🧩 Fixes & Core Improvements
1. **Sidebar Scrolling Issue**
   - Fix the left sidebar so it remains fixed (non-scrollable) while the chat area scrolls independently.
   - Sidebar should stay pinned vertically even when chat messages overflow.
   - Make sure layout uses `position: fixed` or `sticky` with proper height handling (`h-screen`).

2. **Domain Selection Feature**
   - At the top of the chat interface (or in a modal), add a **Domain Selector** dropdown.
   - Available domains:
     - 🧠 General
     - 💻 Web Development
     - 🤖 Machine Learning / AI
     - 📊 Data Science
     - 📝 Academic / Research
     - 🪄 Prompt Engineering
   - The AI’s response tone and logic should adapt based on the selected domain.
   - Save the chosen domain in the chat context so it persists for the session.

3. **Smarter AI Behavior**
   - Fix current issue: when user says “Hi” or “Hello”, the bot shouldn’t generate random code.
   - Make the chatbot respond naturally to greetings, questions, and conversations intelligently.
   - Add a reasoning layer (like ChatGPT) — if the query is conversational, respond textually; if it’s task-based, generate relevant code or explanation.
   - Include context-awareness: the AI should understand previous messages in a session.

4. **Light Mode / Dark Mode**
   - Add a clean theme toggle (sun/moon icon) in the top-right corner.
   - Use Tailwind’s `dark:` mode with smooth transitions.
   - Ensure consistent color palette for both themes (e.g., dark background with neutral gray text; light mode with white background and dark text).
   - Persist the chosen theme in localStorage.

5. **Enhanced UI/UX Design**
   - Make it look **as professional as ChatGPT’s interface**, with:
     - Centered chat container with soft shadows and glassmorphism effect.
     - Beautiful hover effects on buttons and message bubbles.
     - Rounded corners (2xl), proper spacing, and transitions.
     - AI messages in subtle gradient backgrounds with syntax-highlighted code blocks.
     - Use TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for animations (fade-in, slide, and hover transitions).
   - Use adaptive typography for all screen sizes.

6. **Architecture & Components**
   - Components to include:
     - `Sidebar` (fixed) → New Chat, History, Settings, Domain Selector.
     - `ChatArea` → Scrollable chat container with message bubbles.
     - `MessageInput` → Text input with send button.
     - `ThemeToggle` → Light/Dark mode toggle.
     - `DomainSelector` → Dropdown for domain.
     - `WelcomePage` → Short intro with “Get Started” button.
     - `GuideModal` → Optional help pop-up.
   - Ensure seamless navigation between WelcomePage → ChatArea.

7. **Intelligent Backend (Optional Enhancement)**
   - Improve AI reasoning by adding a classification layer:
     - Detect intent → conversation, explanation, or code request.
     - Route the query appropriately to the model (Gemini Pro / text model).
   - Store domain + chat history context for better continuity.

8. **Performance & Compatibility**
   - Fully responsive on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Optimize for both app view and web view.
   - Use TailwindCSS for layout flexibility.
   - Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) for managing theme, domain, and chat context.

### 🎨 Design Goals
- Professional, ChatGPT-like interface.
- Clean fixed sidebar and scrollable chat window.
- Natural conversation flow with contextual memory.
- Smart domain-based response handling.
- Smooth theme transitions.
- Consistent UX across devices.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion
- Backend: Node.js + Express (API routes)
- Database: MongoDB or Firebase
- Model: Gemini Pro API (for reasoning and code generation)
- Auth: Firebase Auth or JWT

### 🚀 Deliverables
- Fixed sidebar layout (non-scrolling).
- Domain selector integrated into the chat.
- Smarter AI reasoning with context memory.
- Light/Dark mode with persistence.
- Fully modern, responsive, animated UI.

Ensure **Devmate v2.1** feels and behaves like ChatGPT — a balanced blend of conversational AI and developer productivity tool.
