You are a professional full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. 
Upgrade my existing "Devmate v2.0 – Powered by Gemini Pro" app into a professional, fully responsive, and user-friendly platform similar to ChatGPT in both design and usability.

### 🎯 Goals
1. **Responsive Design & Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - Make the entire app layout fully responsive on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Ensure smooth scaling of text, icons, chat containers, and sidebar.
   - Use flexible grid/flex layouts with TailwindCSS for perfect alignment.
   - Fix overflow, padding, and layout stretching issues on smaller viewports.

2. **Modern Welcome & Onboarding Page**
   - Add a **dedicated Welcome Page** before login:
     - “Welcome to Devmate – Your AI-Powered Coding Assistant.”
     - Include a brief description: “Generate, debug, and explain code with AI assistance powered by Gemini Pro.”
     - Attractive gradient background with subtle animations.
     - Prominent “Get Started” or “Sign In / Sign Up” button.
     - Simple logo or brand icon at the top center.
   - Optionally add a “Learn More” section explaining features.

3. **User Guidance & In-App Instructions**
   - Show a short onboarding guide (modal or tooltip) for new users:
     - How to start a conversation.
     - How to view chat history.
     - How to manage settings and logout.
   - Add contextual tooltips on icons (copy, download, delete, theme toggle).
   - Add a small “?” Help icon that opens a quick guide modal.

4. **Dashboard & Chat UI Enhancements**
   - Create a **beautiful unified layout** similar to ChatGPT:
     - Sidebar with “New Chat”, “History”, “Profile”, “Settings”, and “Logout”.
     - Main chat area with message bubbles (user vs. AI styled distinctly).
     - AI responses in elegant code blocks with syntax highlighting.
   - Add subtle glow/hover effects and shadows to cards and buttons.
   - Smooth transitions between login, chat, and settings views.

5. **Improved Authentication Flow**
   - Integrate Firebase or JWT Auth (if not already done).
   - Keep users logged in with session persistence.
   - Show user profile card in sidebar after login.
   - Add proper error and success alerts for signup/login/logout.

6. **Global UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Use TailwindCSS with modern design system.
   - Add gradient buttons, rounded corners (2xl), glassmorphism-style cards.
   - Add smooth animations using Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions.
   - Include theme toggle (Light/Dark mode) in top-right corner.
   - Ensure color contrast and text visibility in both modes.

7. **New “Guide” Section (Optional)**
   - Add a “User Guide” or “Docs” page accessible from sidebar.
   - Include sections:
     - “How to Start a Chat”
     - “Saving & Viewing History”
     - “Using AI Actions”
     - “Customizing Appearance”

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (JWT Auth)
- **Database:** MongoDB or Firebase (for users, chats, settings)
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth / JWT-based auth
- **Deployment:** Replit full-stack compatible structure

### 🧩 Deliverables
- Fully responsive, modern UI (ChatGPT-like).
- Clear, guided onboarding flow and welcome page.
- Persistent user sessions and chat history.
- Modular React components (`WelcomePage`, `ChatArea`, `Sidebar`, `GuideModal`, `SettingsPanel`).
- Light/Dark mode with consistent theming.
- Clean folder structure ready for production.

Ensure a polished and intuitive user experience across both web and app views — the UI should look *professional, balanced, and visually delightful*.
