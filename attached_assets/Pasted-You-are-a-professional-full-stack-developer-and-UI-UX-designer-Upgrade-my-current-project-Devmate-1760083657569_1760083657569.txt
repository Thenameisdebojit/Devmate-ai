You are a professional full-stack developer and UI/UX designer. 
Upgrade my current project “Devmate v2.0 – Powered by Gemini Pro” to a modern, premium-quality app like ChatGPT.

### Goals:
1. *Enhance Light Mode Theme*
   - Improve overall contrast and readability.
   - Use a clean, minimalist theme with smooth gradients, shadows, and depth.
   - Keep a professional color palette (soft whites, gray-blue backgrounds, subtle purple/violet accents).
   - Make text, icons, and cards visually clear and distinct.
   - Ensure responsiveness and modern layout consistency.
   - Use smooth transitions, hover effects, and rounded corners (2xl).

2. *Add Complete User Authentication System*
   - Create a *Login / Signup portal*.
   - Signup: Collect user details (Name, Email, Password).
   - Login: Authenticate existing users securely.
   - Logout button on top-right with profile icon.
   - Integrate Firebase Auth or JWT-based Node.js authentication.
   - Encrypt passwords before storing.

3. *Add Database Integration (MongoDB preferred)*
   - Store user profile details and credentials.
   - Save chat histories per user (date, prompt, response).
   - Each session’s chats should be retrievable after login.
   - Allow deleting specific chats or clearing entire chat history.

4. *UI/UX Upgrade (Like ChatGPT)*
   - Left sidebar with:
     - “New Chat”
     - “History” (show chat titles and timestamps)
     - “Profile” and “Settings” buttons.
   - Main Chat Area:
     - Smooth conversation bubbles for user and AI messages.
     - Input box with Send icon and Enter-to-send support.
     - Auto-scroll on new message.
     - Code outputs appear in styled cards with syntax highlighting.
   - Header bar showing app name and user avatar.
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

5. *Optional Add-ons*
   - Theme switcher (Light/Dark mode toggle).
   - Animated loading dots during AI response.
   - Toast notifications for login/signup success/failure.
   - Simple analytics dashboard (e.g., number of chats, sessions, etc).

### Tech Stack (Recommended)
- *Frontend:* React + TailwindCSS
- *Backend:* Node.js + Express
- *Database:* MongoDB (Mongoose)
- *Auth:* Firebase Auth or JWT
- *AI Backend (existing):* Gemini Pro (keep integrated)
- *Deployment:* Replit/vercel-compatible full stack setup

### Deliverables
- Fully working prototype with all features above.
- Responsive and visually appealing UI/UX (like ChatGPT).
- Well-structured folders (client, server, models, routes, components, etc.).
- Replit-ready configuration with environment variables.
